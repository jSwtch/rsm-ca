## What Makes a Good Branding?

There are a few key elements that tie together a great brand. All successful modern brands are designing with fundamental concepts in mind. No two brands should be identical, and while we may strive to reach similar goals the implementation of the principals may appear very different from another.

The most important aspect in establishing a clear brand for your customers is having a consistent representation among all assets. What does this mean? In short "keep it similar". All color use, graphic images, typography, and visual rhythms should have a similar theme across all marketing platforms. We achieve this by working backward - considering the uses cases, and the strengths and weaknesses of multiple approaches, and then we tie it all together to create a consistent theme - unique to your brand.

An effective brand often creates a strong emotional response. Certain colors or imagery can be used to elicit these emotions in your customer and can help establish trust (or business credibility), belief, and ultimate positioning. This is the true purpose of a brand - to establish an accurate representation of value with the customer and the company culture.

With a consistent representation and clear understanding of the value your company is positioned to succeed. You will feel free to market in the correct channels, and your customers will "feel at home" when they find your brand. This is because the consistent representation and accurate value propositions allow you to connect directly and clearly with what your ideal customer is looking for.
