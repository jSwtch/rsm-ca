## What makes a good website?

While every site is different and often requires a unique approach to solving specific design problems. All successful websites will have some universal qualities. Ask your current designer and developer if they have a plan to make your website secure, fast, and unique.

### Strong Visual Appeal

A good website delivers a strong first impression.
Visual elements and thematic setting should clearly establish the brand identity.
Careful use of whitespace allows content to flow and helps prevent users from getting overwhelmed by content.
Content should be delivered in a thoughtful organized manner.

Tasteful use of color should be found throughout the design for added emotion and clarity.
Every graphic element needs a purpose, they should be chosen to elicit a specific response from the user. Overall the site should appear simple and not overwhelming - yet still, intrigue the visitor to investigate.

### Solid Content

Content is what draws your visitors to the site. Thus, content should always be the primary focus. All text should be easy to read, well organized, and extra information clearly labeled. Keeping content up to date can make or break some sites. All content should be engaging and have a clear purpose. When your ideal customer visits your site they should feel right at home. Like you have everything they have been looking for.

### Engaging Functionality

All functional elements should work as intended. Broken links, widgets, and layout are often signs of a poorly developed site. Everything should work as intended, and work quickly. In the world of the web, speed is of the essence.

### Clean & Easy Navigation

Any user should be able to easily navigate the website. All navigation menus should be designed with the user in mind. All page layouts should be themed in a familiar way.
A new website should be extensively tested on multiple browsers to ensure all functionality. Furthermore, each page and layout should be optimized for different user devices. Addressing each of these issues takes considerable time and effort - you will be rewarded with a solid website that you can be proud to stand behind.

### Essential SEO

Search engine optimization is essential for a successful website. There are many aspects of search engine optimization, and it is often used as a buzzword or marketing trap. We always develop our websites with a strong beginner SEO package that includes: semantic markup, well-structured content, keyword placement, descriptive links and images, and using metadata.
