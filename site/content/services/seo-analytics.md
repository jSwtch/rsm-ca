# SEO & Analytics

## What is SEO

Search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Duck Duck Go continuously crawl the internet and index pages. Each page in the index is given a value known as the "rank". Pages with a greater ranking will be displayed first to users who search. Therefore, increasing the ranking of your website with a search engine like Google will increase your exposure and site visits. Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of fine-tuning details of your website to improve its ranking.
