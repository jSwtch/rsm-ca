# A Solid COntent Strategy is Modern Success Marker

## RocketSolid Approach

What is a content strategy? This is the age of digital consumerism. As a society we consume content like never before. Everytime we read a headline or glance at a gallery image we are making a decision. Is this worth clicking on, do I really want to know more, is it worth my time? With such a great consumption of content we need to focus on what our clients expect, and how we want to shape the vision of our future company.

Without a formal content strategy creation of content items may feel random and uncistent with the brand we are building. This is why it is important to consider multiple facets when crafting a content strategy. We develop our content strategies with two considerations: the front end consumption, and the backend organization.

Firstly, the front end consumption of content happens in the browser. The instant a client has clicked, glanced, or read some image, link, or web copy we can say that they have consumed the content. At this poijnt the client either wants to know more, and investigate, or they don't and leave. It is essential to plan the front end consumption of content with the client in mind. This is why we take time to develop proper brandp positioning - we want your clients to "feel at home" when they desicover your business. This emotional response will arise because we will craft your content strategy in such a way hat uniquely fullfills the value proposition for your ideal target customer.

The other side to our content strategy is how all this is managed in the back end. Which posts go to which social media profiles, and why. There is an art to curating the content to best reach each intended consumer. Furthermore what content is stored online? How is this stored, what type of content management system is best suited to your brand. We do not apply a one size fits all approach here. Every project requires a unique approach, and proper backend content strategy.

## What Makes Good content strategy?

A good content strategy comes from having a strong, singular vision for the company. This will ideally be developed in tandem to creating a strong branding package, and planning the web copy.

Our content strategies will help entrepreneurs feel enabled in their vision. It should be clear that with X posts in Y systems and a Z rate for W time they should be established as an expert in their field. This includes a clear sequence of steps that the company can use internally to generate content for their audiences.
