# Set the Industry Standard with a Modern Web app

## RocketSolid Approach

We believe a web app should be developed for a very specific use case. A successful app is built solely around an end user, and designed to solve a specific problem. Whether this app is built for entirely internal use or designed for your clients we believe an app is an excellent chance to establish, and reinforce your brand and company culture.

We build all our app from the group up so we can uniquely design the interface and user experience to match your company style. We use the latest web technologies to deliver a fast product that is secure against attackers.

We have a proven design to development workflow that promises to get you the results you expect. No more surprises, no waiting or guessing games. We can help you through the whole process from inception to deployment.

Our web apps are different from our websites to the extent of functionality. Essentially the web app is a website that can be downloaded offline and was developed with specific functionality in mind. To contrast this with a website which is primarily built to inform, or sell to a user.

## What Makes a Good Web app?

A good web app should be accessible to all users, work as intended, and perform a specific task well. Each web app may be marketed a little differently, however, all good apps will have some core features in common.

### A Great Web app Start with a Great Idea

However, many good ideas may come and go but all are nothing without the proper execution. Even a mediocre idea can become a great success with the proper implementation

### A Successful Web app Needs Proper Execution

Developing a web app is slightly more complex than a website. However many core steps will be the same. Research the target market, usability testing, brand implementation, cross-browser testing, and designing for a full range of devices. Web apps are slightly different in the complexity of the functionality that may be required. Do you need an online store, a social media platform, a database, do you need to tie in with many other web technologies? All potential functionalities should be considered for optimization and potential security risks.

Like a website, a good app will need a distinct brand aligned look and feel, a landing page where potential visitors can sign up, and a clear call to action how they can get involved. Depending on the intended users and functionality proper promotion may make or break the success of the app. Because the app is more complex than a website we perform rigorous stress and usability tests prior to launch. Furthermore, there needs to be a commitment to educate the users and provide updates, or maintenance as required.
