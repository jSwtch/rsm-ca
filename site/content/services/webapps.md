# Set the Industry Standard with a Modern Webapp

## RocketSolid Approach

We believe a webapp should be developed for a very specific use case. A successful app is build solely around an end user, and designed to solve a specific problem. Whether this app is built for entirely internal use or designed for your clients we believe an app is an excellent chance to establish, and reinforce your brand and company culture.

We build all our app from the group up so we can uniquely design the interface and user experience to match your company style. We use the latest web technologies to deliver a fast product that is secure against attackers.

We have a proven design to development workflow that promises to get you the results you expect. No more surprises, no waiting or guessing games. We can help you through the whole process from inception to deployment.

Our webapps are different from our websites in the extent of functionality. Essentially the webapp is a website that can be downloaded offline, and was developed with specific functinalty in mind. To contrast this with a website which is primarily built to inform, or sell to a user.

## What Makes a Good Webapp?

A good webapp should be accessible to all users, work as intended, and perform a spefic task well. Each webapp may be marketed alittle differently however all good apps will have some core features in common.

### A Great Webapp Start with a Great Idea

However, many good ideas may come and go but all are nothing without the proper execution. Even a mediocer idea can become a great sucess with the proper implementation

### A Successful Webapp Needs Proper Execution

Developing a webapp is slightly more complex than a website. However many core steps will be the same. Research the target market, usability testing, brand implementation, cross browser testing, and designing for a full range of devices. Webapps are slightly different in the complexity of the functionality that may berequired. Do you need an online store, a social media platform, a database, do you need to tie in with many other web technoligies? All potential functionalities should be considered for optimization, and potential security risks.

Like a website a good app will need a distint brand aligned look and feel, a landing page where potential visitors can sign up, and a clear call to action how they can get involved. Depending on the intended users and functionality proper promotion may make or break the apps success. Because the app is more complex than a website we perform rigourous stress and usability tests prior to launch. Furthermore, there needs to be a committment to educate the users and provide updates, or maintenace as required.
