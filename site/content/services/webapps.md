# Set the Industry Standard with a Modern Web App

## What Is a Web App?

A web app is essentially an interactive website. The content of a web app will change depending on the type, and level of interaction from the user. A website, however, will display the same information to all users, at all times. Web apps are built for their functionality and are often more complex. Some common use cases for web apps include:

- Online stores
- Browser games
- Email clients
- Social media platforms
- User dashboards
- Client logins

A successful web app is built around an end user, and designed to solve a specific problem. This is an opportunity to invest in greater user engagement, and strengthen company culture and image. Developing a web app for your enterprise can help distinguish your brand as a market leader.
