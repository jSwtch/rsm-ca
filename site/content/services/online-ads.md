## What Makes Good Online Ad?

Good online adds demand attention, develop intrigue, and never become obtrusive. This means a good ad is something the customer doesn't mind seeing, or would prefer over the alternative. God ads are tasteful and direct.

We achieve this effect through a combination of strong headlines, choice graphic elements, and clear call to actions. For long sells like landing pages, we can use testimonials, countdown timers to create a sense of urgency, and various forms of social proof.

At the end of the day, the success of the ad will come down to how consistent and powerful your brand and value proposition is. With the correct approach, we can make it clear why your business is unique, and help customers "feel at home" when they discover your business.

Since there are many ways to implement online advertising it is extremely important to know your target customer, know various approaches for different platforms, and know how to connect your value proposition to your brand through consistent messaging. Most importantly with online ads, it is important to set campaign goals and monitor spending, set a budget and stick to it.
